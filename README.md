# Cardnut

*A backend for someone else's hack at LeedsHack :-)*

A simple Node server that provides a web hook for text messages coming from Twilio, and then broadcasts them to WebSocket clients (in this card, a card game that's playable by a crowd using text messages).

This is not going to be of any interest unless you want some basic Node code for providing a simple Twilio and WebSocket based back-end for pushing messages over WebSocket.
